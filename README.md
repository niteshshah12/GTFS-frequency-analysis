# GTFS-frequency-analysis
The final (intended) product of this analysis is to evaluate transit performance based on its frequency and ability to connect origin and destination. The location of the data is Detroit City, which is a car dominant city, whereas transit performance is not that great. However, transit might be the only means of mobility to population (often vulnerable population). Thus, this analysis can provide insights to improve the transit service by considering transit as a means to connect origins and destination.

The first phase of the analysis is just limited to the frequency of transit by considering static GTFS data (can be found in "Frequency at each stop" notebook in the Github repository).
